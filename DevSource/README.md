Adobe Animate source files (.fla) tend to get very large at times, since they contain all the possible source material, including art, sound and code.
If the file ever exceeds 100MB, I will upload only a reference to the original file and do local versioning, since GitHub LFS might get costly. However, for now it's still under 100MB so the original version is always present.
The source code is added in separate text files, for ease of access.
