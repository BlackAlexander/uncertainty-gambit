Adobe Animate source files (.fla) tend to get very large at times, since they contain all the possible source material, including art, sound and code.
When the file exceeds 100MB, I will upload only a reference to the original file and do local versioning, since GitHub LFS might get costly.
The source code will be added in separate text files, for ease of access.
