## 2D Stealth Game
You're a detective, and your task is a simple one: _make a whole bunch of money_.
You will try to sneak in a quantum horse race track. It works on basic quantum physics principles: before the race ends, all the horses are in superposition. If one is to observe the horse and cause the wave function to collapse before any spectators see the winning horse, he could place a bet on the winning horse, and only he will know the horse that won. And that's exactly what you're going to do. You will need to use your intelligence gathering skills to solve puzzles, complete stealth challenges and overcome obstacles.

## Features
- Quantum physics principles and mechanics incorporated into gameplay
- Fully hand-drawn animations and assets
- Seven different ending scenarios, based on your choices and actions
- Elements of non-Euclidean geometry
- Developed without any game engines, frameworks, or even external libraries
- Unique story <br>
