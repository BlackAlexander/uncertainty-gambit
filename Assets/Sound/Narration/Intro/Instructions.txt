You are going to go in there, and hide until the race begins. Then, you are going to sneak in the race track, entangle yourself with it, and see which horse won. Afterwards, go place a bet on the winning horse, but be careful. After you saw which horse won, if you don't keep contact with it in any possible way, all you did is for nothing, because it won't have a stable position until the race track is uncovered for the public and the podium is subject to quantum decoherence. Also, if you enter contact with any spectator before placing the bet, you will entangle yourself with him and now the whole universe will know which horse won. You must do this flawlessly.
