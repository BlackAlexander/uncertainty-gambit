Those rich idiots bet on quantum horses and don't even know one single thing about quantum physics. It's like the emperor's new clothes, they participate because they're too ashamed to admit they don't understand how it works.
However, though, the races do actually happen in an enclosed system and the horses are in superposition until the race track opens so the public can see it. The system can be tricked, and here is where you come in.
